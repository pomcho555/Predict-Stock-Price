# Predict Stock Price with PyTorch

Let's predict price stock with PyTorch.


## Requirements

My program is made by Python3
So, if your default Python version is 2.x, you should install Python3 or change my codes in order to adapt your version.

- Python3
- PyTorch
- Quandl

## Getting Started

### Installation

Pull my repository.

`git clone https://github.com/komi1230/Predict-Price-Stock.git`

Change directory.

`cd Predict-Price-Stock`

### Requirements

To run this code, let's install some modules.
In my code, I used Quandl, PyTorch and Numpy.
You can install Quandl and numpy following below.

`pip -r install requirements.txt`

But when you install PyTorch, you have to obey PyTorch website.

So, follow [this](http://pytorch.org).

Your default python command in terminal is python3, you should use `pip3`.

### Run

`python agent.py`

If your default python command in terminal is python3, you should use `python3`

## Built With

[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) : You can make Neural Network  
[Quandl](https://www.quandl.com) : You can get many kinds of data
